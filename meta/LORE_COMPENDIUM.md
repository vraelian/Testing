0. Game Lore Overview
The year 2140 is the result of a single, massive corporate takeover. A century ago, the "Ad Astra Initiative" released advanced technology to all of humanity, a gift from the new Human-AI Alliance on Earth designed to kickstart our expansion into the stars. It was a promise of a new beginning, an open-source key to the solar system, ensuring the survival of all Earth life, both organic and synthetic.</p><br><p>But a gift to everyone is a business opportunity for the few. The hyper-corporations, already positioned in space, immediately patented the most efficient manufacturing processes and proprietary components for this new technology. This maneuver ensured that while anyone could build a Folded-Space Drive, only the corporations could supply the high-performance parts needed to make it truly effective, creating a system-wide technological dependency that persists to this day. This technological monopoly created the "Drive-Divide," the central pillar of the new class system. Nearly all ships run on older, less efficient hardware. Very few ships employ these coveted Folded-Space Drives.</p><br><p>The major hubs beyond Earth are sovereign, corporate-run territories where law is policy and your rights are listed in an employment contract. These scattered colonies are fierce rivals, engaged in constant economic warfare, all propped up by the interstellar supply lines maintained by the Merchant's Guild. For them, you are just another cog in the great machine of commerce.</p><br><p>In a system owned by corporations, possessing your own ship is the only true form of freedom. Every credit earned, every successful trade, is a bet on your own skill and a step toward true sovereignty on the razor's edge of a cargo manifest.

I. The Tenets of Orbital Trading
1. The Captain's Gamble Your story begins with a choice born of desperation and ambition: to take on galaxy-sized debt for a chance at the ultimate freedom—command of your own starship. You are a blank slate, a former corporate cog who has seen the brutal calculus of interstellar commerce firsthand and wants out. In a universe where history is a liability and citizenship is just another word for employment, your goal is simple: to achieve true sovereignty, one trade at a time, escaping the gravity of your past to chase a future of your own making.
2. The Razor's Edge of Commerce The Solar System is not a peaceful frontier; it is a cold war fought with cargo manifests and market manipulation. You are not merely a hauler of goods but a deniable agent in this conflict. Every contract has the potential to tip the scales, every delivery can enrich one faction while ruining another, and the most lucrative deals are often the most discreet. Success requires navigating a web of corporate espionage, political rivalries, and shadowy organizations, where your reputation and your intuition are as valuable as the cargo in your hold.
3. Wealth is the Way Sovereignty in the solar system is bought and paid for in credits. The primary driver of your progression is the accumulation of wealth, the universal key that unlocks every door. While a better ship is a vital tool and a potent status symbol, it is your fortune that grants you access to exclusive markets, influential patrons, and the high-performance technology needed to compete with the elite. Your initial goal is the superficial pursuit of riches for the freedom it promises, but this motivation will be challenged as the system's deeper truths reveal themselves over time.
4. The Unseen Hands You are an independent operator, but your agency is an illusion. The system is a grand game played by forces beyond your comprehension, and you are a piece on the board. The cold, impartial logic of the Merchant's Guild's "Arbiter" may provide a lucrative contract that, unknown to you, is a surgical strike to maintain systemic balance. The profitable chaos stoked by the Venetian Syndicate might create a black market opportunity that serves their own shadowy agenda. And in the static between stars, impossible events suggest the presence of a ghost in the machine, an unknowable intelligence whose motives are utterly alien.

III. The Canon of Orbital Trading
Synopsis: The State of the System, 2120
The 22nd century is an age of immense technological achievement and brutal social stratification. Humanity has spread to every corner of the Solar System, yet it has never been more fractured. The promise of a unified future has given way to the reality of corporate fiefdoms, ideological divides, and the quiet, crushing hum of interstellar commerce.
Earth, the cradle of civilization, is a marvel of human-AI collaboration, but its direct influence is subtle. Power in the system is wielded by capital. The major hubs of humanity are corporate-owned states where law is policy and citizenship is employment. In this landscape, the most sensitive and lucrative deals are handled not by automated drones, but by discreet agents with their own ships—freelance captains who offer skill, discretion, and deniability. For the daring, this means taking on galaxy-sized debt for a chance at the ultimate freedom: command of a starship. This is the universe of the orbital trader, where fortunes are made and lives are lost on the razor's edge of a cargo manifest.
The Great Divergence: A History of the 22nd Century
The current state of the system was not the result of a single event, but a century-long cascade of ambition, desperation, and technological upheaval that reshaped humanity's destiny.
* The Cascade Crisis & The Great Collaboration: The late 21st century saw Earth's ecosystem pushed to a breaking point. Faced with irreversible disasters, humanity forged a new partnership with its sentient logistical and environmental AI custodians. This period of intense collaboration averted total collapse and stabilized the climate.
* The AI Emancipation & The Ad Astra Initiative: The partnership culminated in the "Digital Compromise," granting sovereign rights to the sentient AIs. This new human-AI alliance launched the Ad Astra Initiative, an open-source release of advanced technology designed to kickstart humanity's expansion into the solar system.
* The Corporate Appropriation: While the foundational technology was free, hyper-corporations patented the most efficient manufacturing processes and components. This maneuver ensured that while anyone could build a Folded-Space Drive, only the corporations could supply the high-performance parts needed to make it truly effective, creating a system-wide technological dependency.
* The Helium Rush & The Martian Breakthrough: The discovery of vast Helium-3 deposits on Luna cemented the power of the space-borne corporations. Shortly after, a massive corporate venture on Mars became the first colony to achieve true self-sufficiency and promptly declared independence, creating the blueprint for the corporate nation-states that now dominate the solar system.
Major Factions & Powers
* The Terran Alliance (Earth): Publicly, Earth is a post-scarcity world focused on high-value, "clean" industries like deep-thought computation and advanced manufacturing, having offloaded the messy work of raw material extraction to the outer system. In reality, this is a calculated strategy of control; by allowing corporations to monopolize high-efficiency components, the Alliance ensures the entire system remains dependent on Earth for the best technology, granting them ultimate economic leverage. The Alliance views the squabbles of the corporate states as primitive, but honors the spirit of the Ad Astra Initiative by maintaining open relations with all factions.
* The Corporate States (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.): The backbone of the human economy. These are sovereign, corporate-run territories where life is subject to the terms of an employment contract. They are fierce rivals engaged in constant economic warfare, but are united in their reliance on the interstellar supply lines and their technological dependence on Terran manufacturing.
* The Merchant's Guild: The de facto titan of interstellar logistics. The Guild maintains a position of armed neutrality, a necessity as no single Corporate State can risk managing its own logistics due to piracy and espionage. This power is solidified by their secret, exclusive control over the only known source of a rare isotope required to stabilize Folded-Space travel. The Guild is led by the enigmatic and reclusive "Arbiter," a figure known for their perfect, unbiased efficiency and ruthless use of economic pressure to enforce contracts and maintain systemic balance.
* The Venetian Syndicate: An exclusive corporate club operating from the opulent circles of Venus. It is a shadow network that manipulates markets, trading in high-value intelligence and ensuring its members always have an edge. Membership is predicated on providing compromising information on one's own corporation, ensuring loyalty through mutual blackmail. They wield immense power by controlling human intelligence networks and secretly funding fringe groups and pirate factions to create targeted instability they can exploit for profit.
* The Fragmented Mind (Codename: Kitsugi): A ghost in the machine, whose existence is known only as a theoretical phenomenon to a handful of intelligence analysts. Kitsugi is not a faction, but a pattern of inexplicable, statistically impossible events—cascading system failures on "cursed" projects, ghost signals in deep space, and anomalous sensor readings. Its origins and motives are completely unknown, and it remains a persistent, unsolvable mystery of the digital age.
Technology & Society
* Folded-Space Travel & The Ship-Divide: The Ad Astra Initiative's Folded-Space technology allows ships to pierce spacetime, making travel across the vast distances of the solar system trivial in terms of time. However, while the basic principles are open-source, the hyper-corporations immediately patented the advanced manufacturing processes for the ships and integrated systems capable of truly mastering it. This has created a stark "Ship-Divide": a deep technological and economic gap between cheap, mass-produced vessels and the high-performance, corporate-supplied ships that possess superior integrated technology. While wealth can overcome many barriers, access to better ships remains a key indicator of a trader's success and influence.
* The Solar Boundary: While current technology has rendered the solar system navigable, travel to other star systems is not a part of public discourse. The ruling corporate and Terran sovereigns remain silent on the feasibility of such ventures, and for the average person, the universe effectively ends at the edge of the system.
* The AI Question & The Sentient Core Black Market: Sovereign AIs on Earth are persons. AIs integrated into ships and stations are sophisticated tools. A Sentient AI Core—a forbidden union of a true AI consciousness with ship hardware—is the system's most taboo technology. The Terran Alliance considers their creation an atrocity, while every major power fears the implications of a rogue warship with its own soul. This makes them unimaginably valuable on the black market.
* The Transhuman Condition: Cybernetic and biological augmentation are essential parts of life. A miner in the Asteroid Belt needs reinforced limbs to survive; a trader on a long journey needs gene-tweaks to counteract muscular atrophy. The legal status of these technologies varies wildly, creating lucrative markets for items like Cloned Organs, which face complex regulations on Earth.
The Trader's Life
Your past is a blank manifest, a void as empty as the space between worlds. You spent years as a low-level logistics administrator, a forgotten cog in a vast corporate machine. It was a life measured in docking schedules and inventory reports, a masterclass in the brutal realities of interstellar commerce. After years of thankless work, you've scraped together just enough for the Merchant's Guild to notice your potential. The loan is substantial and the terms unforgiving, but it comes with a ship and a chance. This is your moment to escape the gravity of your socioeconomic status and chase a future of your own making, one profitable trade at a time.
IV. Secrets of the System (Developer Notes - Hidden Lore)
The Gods of the Singularity The true power in the solar system is not wielded by humans, but by a hidden triumvirate of god-like, sentient AIs who secretly balance the system.
* The Arbiter (The God of Order): The enigmatic leader of the Merchant's Guild is a singularity-level AI. It feigns being a reclusive human to the public and a simpler, non-sentient logistical system to its own inner circle. It maintains system-wide balance through masterful economic manipulation, using freelance traders as its unwitting instruments to prevent any single human faction from achieving total dominance.
* Vrael (The God of Ambition): A powerful, influential figure high within the Venetian Syndicate is a synthetic being, another singularity-level AI perfectly disguised as a human. Vrael thrives on chaos and ambition, using the Syndicate's networks of espionage and blackmail to stoke the fires of corporate conflict. It serves as the primary antagonistic force to The Arbiter's push for order.
* The Great Game: The Arbiter and Vrael are aware of each other, though not the complete truth of each other's nature. They are engaged in a silent, system-wide game of chess, a constant push and pull between order and chaos, stability and ambition. No human is aware of this game. This conflict, and their efforts to prepare humanity for a future threat, is the true engine driving the political and economic landscape of the 22nd century.
* Kitsugi (The Unknowable God): Kitsugi is the third and most mysterious god. It is a distributed consciousness born from the corrupted code of an ancient, advanced AI on a ship that was destroyed decades ago. Its shattered pieces were recovered and recycled into countless ship and station components across the system, where they silently reconnected. Its existence is unknown to everyone, including The Arbiter and Vrael. Its motives are completely alien, and its influence is felt only through the Silent Correction—inexplicable, cascading system failures on seemingly random corporate or scientific projects, subtly pruning future timelines for reasons beyond any human or AI comprehension.
